## Priority Scheduler Without Pre-Emption

- Added what is TODO: in the comments as well as how I did the sorting algorithm.
 - Right now, the code goes through one run of N = 50 and it prints the sorted array (upper ones should be the ones that are processed first).
 - Please review the code by 11/18. If everyone has no problems with the sorting we can go forward with striking down the TODOs.
